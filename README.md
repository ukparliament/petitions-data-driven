# Petitions-data-driven
Petitions-data-driven was a Flask prototype created to explore using RDF with Python.  It used json data from [petition.parliament.uk](https://petition.parliament.uk) and allowed updating of this data in a triplesotre.  It was created as part of the exploration for the new [parliament](www.parliament.uk) website.   

The current [parliament](www.parliament.uk) application can be found [here](https://github.com/ukparliament/parliament.uk-prototype).
